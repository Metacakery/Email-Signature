### How to: Mac
1. Open "Mac Mail"
2. Click preferences
3. Click signatures
4. Click the + to add a new signature. This step is simply to allow Mac Mail to create a new signature document that you will later edit directly. _**Note:** Leave the signature open through out the rest of these step so that you will not need to navigate to it later. Even if you quick Mail, as you will in later steps, leave the window open. Mail will restart with the signature still open._
5. Click back to the desktop finder.
6. From finder option+click "Go" from finder menu bar, the menu bar is at the top of your screen. You must continue to hold option even after you have clicked "Go". This will open a hidden folder were you fill find the new signature document that was create earlier.
7. Click "Library". This will open a new finder window pointed at the hidden library folder.
8. With in the new window navigate to: / Mail / V2 / MailData / Signatures /
9. Set the finder window "view" to "list". This will allow you to change the "order by" setting.
10. Set the finder window to order by "Date Modified". This will allow you to see the signature you just created as it should jump to the top of the list as the most recently modified file. The new signature document name is going to be a ridiculously none-readable name. Viewing by "Date Modified" is the easiest way to be sure you are viewing the file that Mac Mail just created.
11. Open the signature document to copy past the new html in place of current html. 
12. Open the file you received that contains the new html signature.
13 Copy the new html into your clipboard by selecting all and copy.
14. Select the new signature document and select the existing html. Be sure you only select the html and not the text that is above it. Place the cursor at the beginning of the body tag.
15 Paste the new html in place of the existing html.
16. Save the file.
17. Restart Mac Mail. _You should still have the signature dialog window open, please leave it open when your quit Mail because it will re-open itself when you restart the application.
18. Go to the signature you created in the previous step and the new html will be visible.
19. Any further changes to the signature file will require you to restart Mac Mail to view the changes.
